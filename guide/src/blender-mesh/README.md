# Blender Mesh

The `blender-mesh` crate contains data structures and methods for working with meshes.

While the guide will be written with Blender users in mind, please note that
a mesh is just a collection of data and as such almost all of `blender-mesh` knows nothing about
`Blender` and can be used standalone.

This chapter will introduce and explain different mesh data and functions.

The [full API documentation][api] can be found on `docs.rs`.

The JSON that is exported by the CLI matches the structure of the API, so the API is still a good
reference for CLI-only users.
